# 📡 **Telco Churn Prediction using Machine Learning**  

🚀 **Predict customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning models.**  

## 📌 **Overview**  
This repository contains a **Machine Learning model** designed to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry using the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**. The goal is to analyze customer behavior and predict whether a customer is likely to leave their service provider.  

## 📂 **Dataset**  
- **Name:** Telco Customer Churn  
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **Features:**  
  - **Account Information:** Tenure, contract type, payment method, monthly charges, total charges  
  - **Service Usage:** Internet service type, online security, tech support, etc.  
  - **Target Variable:** **Churn (Yes/No)**  

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - 🗂 **Data Processing:** `pandas`, `numpy`  
  - 📊 **Data Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## 📊 **Model Workflow**  

### 🔹 **1. Data Preprocessing**  
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Feature scaling & engineering  

### 🔹 **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Distribution of churned vs. non-churned customers  
- Correlation between features  
- Visualizing churn patterns  

### 🔹 **3. Model Training & Evaluation**  
- Train/Test Split  
- Model selection (**Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost**)  
- Performance Metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**  

## 🔮 **Future Improvements**
