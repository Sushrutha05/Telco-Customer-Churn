 📊 Telco Churn Prediction using Machine Learning  
 

## 🚀 Overview  
This repository contains a **Machine Learning model** designed to predict customer churn in the **telecommunications industry** using the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**. The goal is to analyze customer behavior and predict whether a customer is likely to leave the service provider.  

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Name:** Telco Customer Churn  
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **Features:**  
  - **Account Information** (tenure, contract type, payment method, monthly charges, total charges)  
  - **Service Usage** (internet service type, online security, tech support, etc.)  
  - **Target Variable:** Churn (Yes/No)  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - pandas, numpy (Data Processing)  
  - matplotlib, seaborn (Data Visualization)  
  - scikit-learn (Machine Learning)  

## 📊 Model Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Encode categorical variables  
   - Feature engineering  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of churn  
   - Correlation between features
